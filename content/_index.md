# I Think in Structure.

Algorithms are consequences.

I work on graphs, domination, partitions,  
and the quiet elegance of structure.

Welcome to a place where proofs meet implementation,  
and structure occasionally wins over brute force.

## 🧠 Research

Structural graph theory, domination variants,  
and translating structural results into efficient algorithms.

## 🎓 Teaching

I design courses around problems, not slides.

Simulation over memorization.  
Understanding over repetition.
