# Hi!.

I am a father to a beautiful daughter,  
a husband to a patient and wonderful wife,  
a son to a strong father and a loving mother, a friend and student for lifetime

I love to teach and code. 

And most days, I am simply trying to understand why things work.

My doctoral work was in structural graph theory,
where I spent several years studying domination in planar graphs
and proving results around open questions in the area.

I have always enjoyed the clarity of a good proof: 
when an argument finally fits together
and a difficult problem becomes understandable.

But my curiosity does not end with proving results.
I am equally interested in what happens when ideas move beyond theory:
when they are translated into algorithms,
implemented, and tested in practice.

Over time, my interests are broadening,
not by moving away from theory,
but by applying the same way of thinking to different questions.

Lately, I also find myself drawn to other areas that are rooted in theory,
especially where new models of computation are being explored.
For now, these are curiosities rather than commitments, 
but I am always interested in understanding how things work at a deeper level.

I was fortunate to work with a great mentor (Dr. Deepak Rajendraprasad) who shaped not only my research,
but my way of thinking.
He valued rigor over visibility,
clarity over complexity,
and carried himself with a quiet humility that left a lasting impression on me.

## 🧠 Research

My research explores structural properties of graphs,  
dominating sets and their variations,  
and how theoretical insight can lead to efficient algorithms.

## 🎓 Teaching

I enjoy teaching because it forces clarity.

I prefer problems over slides,  
reasoning over memorization,  
and questions over quick conclusions.
