## Academic Profile

My doctoral work focused on domination in planar graphs within structural graph theory. More broadly, I am interested in modeling problems theoretically, uncovering the structure beneath complexity, and understanding how that structure leads to efficient algorithms.

Teaching is a passion for me. I believe in building curiosity in students and encouraging them to ask why. That, to me, matters most.

## Technical Background

My programming perspective is rooted in concepts rather than languages.  
I am comfortable adapting across syntaxes and paradigms, with experience in Python, PHP, Java and related environments.

I have designed and built systems using both SQL and NoSQL databases, and have worked on full-stack web applications in industry and freelance settings, including participation in an early-stage startup.
