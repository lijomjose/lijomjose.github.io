## Technical Background

My programming perspective is rooted in concepts rather than languages.  
I am comfortable adapting across syntaxes and paradigms, with experience in Python, PHP, Java and related environments.

I have designed and built systems using both SQL and NoSQL databases, and have worked on full-stack web applications in industry and freelance settings, including participation in an early-stage startup.
