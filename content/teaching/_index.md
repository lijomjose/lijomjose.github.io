## Teaching Philosophy

I love to teach.

Interestingly, I did not plan to become a teacher.
I began my career wanting to be a programmer. After some time in industry, I realized that while I enjoyed building systems, much of the work felt repetitive and constrained. The space for deeper thinking was limited.

Teaching began as an experiment: one I was not even sure I would enjoy.

My first batch of students changed that. In their questions, confusion, and gradual clarity, I found something I had been missing: the joy of thinking together.

Later, my time at IIT Palakkad as a Research student. Working with some exceptional teachers, and even better human beings, exposed me to a different academic culture; one that valued clarity over display, depth over speed, and humility over performance. 

They showed me that a teacher can be more than a resource; a teacher can be an influence.

Over time, I found myself gravitating toward subjects like programming, graph theory, data structures, and algorithms; areas where structure and intuition meet.

At their core, these subjects are not about syntax or formulas.
They are about understanding why something works.

The system we work within often emphasizes coverage and examinations. Unfortunately, I also work within that structure. Still, I often wish courses were designed with intuition first; with more questions than answers, more thinking than memorization.

Within the limitations, I try to keep that spirit alive.

In mathematics, that may mean pausing to think why a proof holds.
In algorithms, it may mean appreciating the elegance of an idea before analyzing its complexity.
In programming, it may mean asking why this code has to be there or is there a better way before writing the code.

I may not be able redesign the educational system of which I am a part of.
But inside the room, I try to make it a place where curiosity is not rushed.

To me, teaching is not the transfer of information.
It is the careful cultivation of understanding.
